# PHP Software Engineer test

We're looking for a PHP Software Engineer, we want it to be you, but first you need to pass this test.

## Prerequisites

We expect you have knowledge of the following:

- Composer, the PHP Dependancy Package Manager
- PHP 5.3 or newer
- Interpreting and manipulating JSON
- Ensuring the platform you install this on can connect at least to www.commonledger.com via HTTP (TCP port 80). Note: www.commonledger.com has a rotating IP address
- Intention is to run this via CLI PHP, but if you're more comfortable you're more than welcome to run this via a webserver

## Getting started

Great, so you've passed the first step. That pretty much shows you're a seasoned PHP coder. 

Now, there are no further instructions so it's up to __you__ to make this work. You will need to write code and also ensure the payload makes it to us containing your contact details when successfully running the code.

> Hint: All the hints will be inside the code.

## How to pass the test

When successful, you will receive a relative response to the question;

``
"Why did the chicken cross the road?"
``

This means your details have been successfully sent to us and we will be in touch shortly.

> If you find code is broken, and if you'd like bonus points you can issue a pull request with the patch and instructions on how to fix.
